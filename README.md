Vidom is just a library to build UI. It's highly inspired and based on ideas from React (https://facebook.github.io/react/). Its main goal is to provide as fast as possible lightweight implementation with API similar to React.

## Main features
  * Fast virtual DOM builder and patcher under the hood
  * Easy and clear way to subscribe to and unsubcribe from DOM Events
  * API to build your own high-level components
  * Server-side rendering with the ability to reuse existing DOM in the browsers also known as isomorphism.
  * Namespaces support (e.g., SVG, MathML)
